# Todo Application

A polished, animated checklist with filtering, live stats, and local storage so your tasks stay put between visits.

## Features
- Add, edit, delete, and clear completed tasks with a single click
- Filters for All / Active / Completed plus live counters for each state
- Keyboard-friendly input (hit Enter to add) and inline editing for speed
- Local storage persistence—refresh without losing your list
- Responsive, glassy UI with subtle gradients and motion cues

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or use a live server extension for hot reloads).
3. Start adding tasks—no build step or dependencies required.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Page markup and shell
- `assets/css/style.css`: Visual system, theming, and animations
- `assets/js/script.js`: Todo logic, filtering, and persistence
- `assets/images/image.png`: Blurred background texture (replace with your own brand art if desired)

## Customization
- Adjust the accent colors and background in `style.css` (see the `:root` variables).
- Change the local storage key (`STORAGE_KEY` in `script.js`) if you want to isolate multiple lists.
